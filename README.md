# BCH_and_ReedSolomon

Implement demos for BCH and Reed-Solomon encoder / decoder in python.

This Repository uses algorithms in reference book.

# Run

just use python BCH.py or python ReedSolomon.py for demo

1. [The Theory of Information and Coding (book)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/theory-of-information-and-coding/3EF5291C0C1F716387B172847CFD35FC)

Very CLEAR and DETAILED book in explaining the theory and algorithms in coding.

2. [BCH-codes-python (project)](https://github.com/moehw/BCH-codes)

Very FAST and SMART implementation for BCH coding. The author use bits in integer for Galois Field, namely GF(2) and GF(2^m). But due to its simplicity, it can not change to Reed-Solomon directly.

3. [galois (python lib)](https://mhostetter.github.io/galois/latest/getting-started/)

Very GOOD GF(p) and GF(p^m) library extending Numpy. It can be installed by pip.
